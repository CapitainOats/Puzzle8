Extension

These extensions offer a variety of different ways you might extend the basic Puzzle-8 functionality:

- Replace the use of the standard Java PriorityQueue object, with your own min-heap-based implementation of a priority queue. You only need to support a simple constructor and three methods (add, remove and isEmpty) and you can make your implementation PuzzleBoard-specific (it does not need to handle generic types).
- Animate the movement of each tile (rather than having them jump into position)
- Support playing the game by swiping the tiles instead of tapping them
- Add a "settings" activity that allow the user to select the desired number of tiles
- Instead of using the thumbnail provided by the ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE intent, try using the full-definition image taken by the camera.
- Allow the user to select taking a new photo or using a photo from their image folder
